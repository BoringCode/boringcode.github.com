# boringcode.github.io

I've moved my site to a VPS: [bradleyrosenfeld.com](https://bradleyrosenfeld.com). You can find its [source code](https://github.com/BoringCode/bradleyrosenfeld.com) on GitHub.

The original site code is located in the [original-site](https://github.com/BoringCode/boringcode.github.com/tree/original-site) branch. It is old and ugly, but it's there.
