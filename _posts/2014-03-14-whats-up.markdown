Happy Pi Day internet! Today marks my 20th birthday and I thought I would celebrate by telling a story. One depressing, early morning I was sitting in my Visual Communications class at [Taylor University](http://taylor.edu) and I felt inspired. I scribbled a few things in my notebook and thought about cute puppies. This "fancy" new website is the result. I never was a good storyteller.

##New Design

My old website filled its purpose well. It was a simple one pager that basically introduced who I am and some of the work that I've done.

Although I liked how the website looked initially, as time went on I slowly began to dislike the dark design and the stark yellow that I chose.

With the new design I have lightened up the overall color scheme. I moved away from the yellow and dark gray and went to nice blue, red, and (lighter) grays. Typography is a big component of the new style. I am using [Bitter](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Bitter) for titles and [Source Sans Pro](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) for body text. Bitter is an especially good looking serif typeface that is stable and trustworthy looking.

Another big change is using a static site generator. I host this website with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) which has [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) built in. Jekyll works really well and for the most part it stays out of the way. After some trial and error, I learned how to use template tags and some other cool tricks that Jekyll has up its sleeve. Although I have not open sourced the code, you can see how I used Jekyll on the [Github repo](https://github.com/BoringCode/boringcode.github.com).

##New Blog

Although I would like to write more, I am under no illusion of writing every day or week. This blog will serve as a place for me to talk about things that interest me. Everything from programming to the latest gadget from Apple.

Strap yourself in, this should be an interesting ride. At least for me that is.
