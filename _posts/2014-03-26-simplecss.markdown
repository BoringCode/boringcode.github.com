Chris Broski has been experimenting with the minimum amount of CSS necessary to create a readable web page.

His reasoning for each of the 4 CSS rules is sound. I especially like the use of :first-child to remove extra margins. The only thing that he is missing is some simple rules to make sure images and iframes stay within the body. But, Chris says that he will add updates on the [Github repo](https://github.com/chrisbroski/simple-css).
