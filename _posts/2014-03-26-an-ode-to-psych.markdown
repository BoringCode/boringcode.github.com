When I first started watching [Psych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych), I thought it was a weird soap opera. I caught the end of "Mr. Yin Presents" and thought, "those two women sure cry a lot." What I didn't know was that I would stop for a pee but stay for a lifetime.

Even after my strange exposure to Psych, the weekly adventures of Shawn Spenstar and Gus TT Showbiz always kept me coming back. What made Psych special wasn't just the comedy or the dark mysteries. It was the relationship between the two lead characters.

Shawn Spencer changed a lot over 8 seasons. He began as an unemployed, irresponsible jerk and ended as an unemployed, irresponsible weirdo. I'm not being fair, as he did learn how to care about others besides himself. Beginning with Gus, then Abigail, and finally Juliet. Sometimes he cared about Lassiter, but c'mon son. Shawn was a just a guy who skated through life on ice skates of eloquence. But I loved his character more than cinnamon pie.

Gus always bounced back. He would scream and cry at the sight of another dead body, but the next day he would be back behind the wheel of his Toyota Echo just waiting for another adventure. For some inexplicable reason, Gus never minded that Shawn never introduced him by his real name. Only when interviewing a pretty girl would Gus jump in and introduce himself with his deepest and manliest voice. Burton Guster will be missed as the only black lead on a network television show.

One aspect of the show that was missing in later seasons was the Lil' Shawn and Lil' Gus intros. These memories always had something to do with the upcoming episode and they were really cute. I'm going out on a limb here, but the show went downhill when they removed those intros.

Psych's never-ending parodies and spoofs of pop culture just added to the fun. My favorite episode may be "Mr. Yin Presents" which was entirely themed after Alfred Hitchcock movies. The creators of the show must have really liked horror films. Episodes like "Heeeeere's Lassie" (spoof of The Shining) and "Tuesday the 17th" (spoof of every "young adults in a cabin in the woods" movie ever but mostly Friday the 13th) were a part of almost every season. References to the 1980's abounded along with Gus' nicknames that had something to do with a character in a 80's movie. I'm taking back what I said earlier. It was pop culture references, not the characters, that made Psych great.

Psych comes to an end tonight. The end of the series is sad. Sure, I realize that it is just a TV show that must come to an end at some point. But I will miss the buddy psychic detective antics that define Psych. On the bright side, there is always Netflix.
