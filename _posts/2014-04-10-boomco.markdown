Interesting article from Fast Co. Design about how Mattel is attempting to take on Nerf.

I'll admit, I'm a Nerf fanboy. But I love the idea of plastic darts that will stick really well to almost anything. If Mattel nails it like the article says they have, I'd love to pick up a few of the blasters.
