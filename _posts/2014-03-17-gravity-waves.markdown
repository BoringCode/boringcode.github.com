Clara Moskowitz, writing for Scientific American:

> Physicists have found a long-predicted twist in light from the big bang that represents the first image of ripples in the universe called gravitational waves, researchers announced today. The finding is direct proof of the theory of inflation, the idea that the universe expanded extremely quickly in the first fraction of a nanosecond after it was born.

I remember reading in my old physics textbooks about the idea that gravity might be a wave. It is pretty hard to believe that scientists might have actually found hard evidence of its actual nature.
