Alix Spiegel, writing for NPR:

> For the past three years, Rich and 3,000 other average people have been quietly making probability estimates about everything from Venezuelan gas subsidies to North Korean politics as part of , an experiment put together by three well-known psychologists and some people inside the intelligence community. According to one report, the predictions made by the Good Judgment Project are often better even than intelligence analysts with access to classified information, and many of the people involved in the project have been astonished by its success at making accurate predictions.

Crowdsourcing can be incredibly effective in so many different fields; everything from [science](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/) to analyzing intelligence. What's interesting is how the "crowd" can be smarter than the analysts. The article has a few ideas of why this is the case, but I wonder if the prediction accuracy of analysts is also dependent on the culture in the intelligence community.
