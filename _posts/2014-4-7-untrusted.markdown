Alex Nisnevich and Greg Shuflin created a browser game where you have to change the source files to win. So basically you are encouraged to cheat. The concept is clever and there is even music to set the mood as you hack your way to victory. Now please excuse me as I escape the clutches of the MACHINE CONTINUUM!
