title:  "An Ode to Psych"
---
When I first started watching [Psych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych), I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Today, after 8 seasons I think it may be the greatest work of comedic art ever.

Yes, I'm being hyperbolic. But, the weekly adventures of Shawn and Gus TT Showbiz always kept me coming back.
